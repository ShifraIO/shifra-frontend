Our focus is on enabling women and girls with knowledge to make their own decisions about their own health care options.</li></ul><h3>Shifra uses mobile technology and data analytics to increase access to quality reproductive health for Australia’s new migrants and refugees.</h3><ul><li>We work with all stakeholders to co-design each and every version of Shifra to ensure it fits that particular community.</li><li>We develop the local capacity of communities so they are the ones maintaining and improving Shifra long term.</li><li>We integrate evaluation tools into our implementation design to ensure we are measuring impact from the start.</li></ul><br/><center><b>We believe that for women and girls to count, they need to be counted!</b><br/><br/><b>We are working towards improving reproductive health access for the millions of women and girls around the world who currently lack it.</b><br/><br/><b>We want you to join the the Shifra movement and help us get there sooner.
